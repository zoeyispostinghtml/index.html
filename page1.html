If I’m being completely honest, painting, wasn’t one of my prioritized art styles for a long time. I wanted and still want to specialize in fine arts outside of paint such as: graphic novels, animation, songwriting… But again, then the lava line opened up and painting became one of my main forms of art in 2023. 
There’s a lot I still want to learn regarding painting styles. It’s easy to surf the Internet and find tutorials on how to paint, but mastering those skills and giving yourself patience is the hard part. At least that’s what I struggle with. I suppose my lesson in my own art journey is learning how to grow and accepting that skill takes time and consistency. 
I used to paint in high school for small projects or for fun outside of my regular sketchbooks. Now, some of my favorite painting pieces are those that I didn’t plan on creating, they just simply happened in the moment. One time I went to a sip and paint for one of my friends’ birthdays and created a moon piece that is still hung on my walls today. The painting displayed in this HTML file is of an abstract backdrop with an abstract woman painted on the front that I showed in an art show downtown Castle Rock. the abstract background wasn’t actually created by me. I found this canvas at Goodwill and decided to add my art to it as well. It was a very fun project to do.
