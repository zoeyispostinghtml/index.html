<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p> For as long as I can remember, art has been my number one way of expressing myself and navigating the world around me. Whether that be creating characters, scribbling on paper, painting little scenic backgrounds, or singing songs to my mom at 8 years old, art has been there for me. 
I only began to realize the importance of art as I got older and what it did for me. It became more than just a childhood hobby, I continued to create in my teens and then into adulthood. It took me until the ripe age of 21 years old to realize that my main goal in life is to be an artist.
I want to thank anybody who is on this website right now for viewing little pieces of my creations. It is one of my biggest joys being able to spread what I make and connect with other artists. 
<br>
	Currently, my artistic goals are to become a published graphic novelist, and Remote freelance artist, of some sort.<br>
	I have two written novels, four graphic novels, and a music album in the works currently. I can’t wait until the day when I get to hold these creations in my hands after all of the hard work I’ve put into making them. For now, I am prioritizing the journey and the art that comes along the way, which is what you would get to see here on this website.</p>
