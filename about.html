<p> I decided to formally start my art business in early 2023, launching my LLC brand “ the lava line.” At first, it was hard to decide what I wanted to specialize in. I felt that I had so many art expressions and art styles I could sell that picking only one was a struggle. I wanted to sell crochet, sell my comic books, sell prints of my artwork, and offer my services as a live Wedding Painter. I decided to categorize all of these and wing it, publishing the lava line as a versatile website. In 2023, I did four live wedding paintings sessions for clients who heard about my business during peak wedding season, and I prioritized bettering my crochet art. My comic books weren’t ready to be sold, as they are still in the making.


<br>

My current starting price for a standard live painting on a 16”x20” canvas is $500. The price can vary depending how many people are in the painting, specifications or ad ins, and the location on where the event is. I’m more than willing to travel but do require compensation. Currently, I am located south of Denver and do not charge Colorado residences within 100 miles for a travel fee! 
Once we discuss whether or not this is a service you would like for your wedding, I require payment a month out prior to the wedding/event date. Life happens and I want to be available to flex for either my clients or myself! 
I accept: cashiers checks, Zelle, Venmo, and cash. 
<br>
I offer four original painting options for your event:
    ⁃    Live painting the ceremony/ kiss 
    ⁃    Live painting the first dance 
    ⁃    Live painting the first look 
    ⁃    At home commission painting, a painted surprise scene before the wedding occurs, of your engagement, or if your wedding has already past
Note: For the at home option, I do require photographs of the event and of the people. 

Process 
I arrive at the venue preferably 3-4 hours prior to the event to set up and begin on the backdrop of painting. When the event begins, I live paint the couple then and there! 
I bring a small drop cloth, my painting easel, the canvas, and an “art cart” with my paints, water, and brushes! 

Email me with any questions, comments, or thoughts you have, I hope to hear from you soon!
